# Test cases generator
Mainly used for generating multiple testcases for codeforces polygon problem setting

## How it works
Inputs are:
* Number of testcases
* Number of variables in each test
* Start and end range for each variable.

Testcases are saved inside "tests/" folder.

## Known issues
- [ ] Some languages (like python) require a specific structure for testcases (input.split for example), but this script creates test in a single line.
